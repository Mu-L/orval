### Playground

## Developers

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management and building. Here are the key scripts available for development:

### Prerequisites

Before using Yarn scripts, ensure you have Yarn installed. You can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Alternatively, you can enable Corepack (which comes with Node.js 16.10+) to manage Yarn:

```bash
corepack enable
```

### Build Scripts

- **`yarn nuke:all`** - Completely clean your workspace by removing all build artifacts, node_modules, and cached files. Use this when you want to start fresh.

- **`yarn build`** - Build the project and make changes available to the workspace. Run this after making code changes to compile TypeScript and prepare the project for use.

### Test Scripts

- **`yarn test`** - Run unit tests in all packages.

- **`yarn update-samples`** - Generate sample outputs using the newly built version of Orval. This regenerates the sample code based on the current build.

- **`yarn test:samples`** - Run tests in the samples directory using the newly generated output from `update-samples`.

- **`yarn test:cli`** - Test that the generated output (not samples) is valid TypeScript. This validates the TypeScript compilation of the generated code.

### Development Workflow

A typical development workflow would be:

1. Make your code changes
2. Run `yarn build` to compile your changes
3. Run `yarn test` to ensure unit tests pass
4. Run `yarn update-samples` to regenerate sample outputs
5. Run `yarn test:samples` to verify samples work correctly
6. Run `yarn test:cli` to validate TypeScript compilation

If you encounter issues or want to start completely fresh:

1. Run `yarn nuke:all` to clean everything
2. Reinstall dependencies and rebuild from scratch
